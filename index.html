            <h2>How to Play Old Maid!</h2>
            <p>
                Old Maid is a simple card game. The objective is to avoid being the player left with the unmatched card, known as the Old Maid.
                <br><br>
                1. All players are dealt an equal number of cards. One card, usually a Queen, is removed to create the Old Maid.
                <br>
                2. Players remove pairs of matching cards from their hand.
                <br>
                3. Players take turns drawing a card from the next player's hand.
                <br>
                4. If the drawn card forms a pair with another card in hand, the pair is removed.
                <br>
                5. The game continues until all pairs are removed and only the Old Maid remains.
                <br>
                Have Fun!
